    "- q. notice how \"researcher\" is not one of the agents in this mix, nor are we giving it any tools that let it search the web. does that mean that the agent relies on the LLM it is using as its sole source of information? or do our agents have access to the internet despite us not explicitly providing them with web search tools?\n",
